## Production

### Production Commands

This section explains the available scripts in the `package.json` file and their usage during production deployments.

- `yarn build`  
  This command builds the static site for production using the `next build` command. It generates an optimized build of the site that is suitable for deployment.

- `yarn export`  
  This command exports the static site for production using the `next export` command. It generates an optimized build of the site that is suitable for deployment. The exported site is saved in the `out` directory.

- `yarn start`  
  This command first runs `yarn build` to generate an optimized build of the site and then starts the production server using the `next start` command. Use this command to test the site in a production-like environment locally.
